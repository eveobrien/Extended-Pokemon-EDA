# Extended-Pokemon-EDA
Like the Pokemon-EDA Repository, this is a much larger dataset with 41 columns and over 800 data points.
I aim to come to some great conclusions about different types of Pokemon with this dataset, for example, the strongest/weakest pokemon, ones 
with the most skills, the most/least common types, and maybe a battle system to predict which Pokemon would win in a battle.
